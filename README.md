# Roman_Arabic_Converter
### About:
This project uses Docker Compose tool/configuration for defining and running two Docker containers. The first container has a Node.js API microservice which can be requested to convert Roman numerals to Arabic numbers. The second container has a light React website built with webpack. The website calls the microservice when a user inputs a Roman numeral on the webite. Arabic number field on the website is updated based on the response from the microservice. 

Build, create and start by running docker commands. E.g. docker-compose up --build
